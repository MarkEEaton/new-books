# Make an HTML document out of a spreadsheet of new books

- This script was developed to solve a specific problem faced by our librarians: how to turn a spreadsheet of new books into an HTML document quickly and easily.
- Because our acquisitions librarian needed to be do this regularly, coding the HTML by hand was not a viable option.
- So the script we wrote automatically produces an HTML output from a CSV file. This HTML is suitable for cutting and pasting into a LibGuide.
